## Introduction

Managers and engineers often struggle to organise their daily tasks. This app's design is geared towards a daily set of tasks. I wanted to create an app that dynamically updated HTML and CSS elements using jQuery and Bootstrap.

While making this app, I learned about the importance of event delegation to make code look neater, as well as the convenience of client-side local storage.

## Usage
